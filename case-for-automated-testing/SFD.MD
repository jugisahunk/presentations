[Business Case for Automated Testing](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/insights/blog/making-business-case-automated-testing)
# A business case
Within your own organization, you may want to look at the following, in terms of making your business case:

## Regression Testing costs  
this may be your easiest way to quantify a return on investment.  What does it cost you to manually regression test your most expensive features?  How much would it cost you to set up automated testing on those features?  It is likely that you'll have some parts of your application where the one-time cost of setting up an automated regression test will pay for itself within the year, in terms of making your manual testers available to do other important testing of new features as they are written.
## Software development costs  
if you're in a position to do so, quantify the number of points your project teams deliver per iteration, to get a "cost per point."  If your teams are routinely interrupted to fix production bugs and put in patches, you should be able to quantify the cost of these unplanned interruptions, in terms of undelivered feature points.  The costs will likely add up to tens of thousands of dollars quite easily.
## Insurance analogy:  
cost of unexpected down time for your application.  Calculate the cost to your company for down time to your application.  Even if down time is not catastrophic, since manual work-arounds are available, you should be able to quantify the value of the time of staff diverted to doing manual work-arounds during software down time.  If automated tests give you better quality software and reduced down time, a large-scale investment in automated testing may be justified.
## Business losses due to lack of speed in adding new features:  
this may be harder to readily quantify, but as your software gets harder to change, you will lose the agility you intended to gain when your company first took on agile software development techniques.  You may want to put together one or two hypothetical or real cases of changes which were much more expensive to deliver due to the cost of manual regression testing than they would have been, had automated testing been in place.  Depending on what your software does, you should be able to assign a business value to software flexibility, in terms of business lost due to delayed time to market.
## Total software replacement cost  
at some point your software will become partially or completely impossible to repair, due to the cost of regression testing the whole.  What is the cost of starting all over?  On the other hand, if your company was planning to totally replace the software during some short time horizon, then maybe your manual testing is fine.

# Why automated testing matters
## Happy Product Owner
### Speed to market
### Maximing time developing features (avoiding rework)
### Minimizing mean time to repair/restore
## Happy customers
### Reduced disruption
### Needed / wanted features more often
## Happy developers
### Pride of workmanship
### Skills fully utilized (avoid misused skills waste)
### Comfort
#### I know my code works
#### If my code breaks, I can fix it quicly with confidence.
## Happy CFO
### Better product cash flow
### Better return on product investment
