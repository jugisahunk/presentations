   # The Tortoise and the Hare
## The Tortoise and the Hare (how continuous improvement can overtake rapid improvement)
## Trust the team (how I have to keep getting over myself and practice what I preach)
## Hope Springs Eternal (how servant leadership for me means guarding the hope others aren't ready to embrace)
## Go where you are wanted (the impact of a Scrum Master who's time has come)

There's an old story that many of you have heard before. 

A Hare was making fun of the Tortoise one day for being so slow.

"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.

"Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."

The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance and started the runners off.

The Hare was soon far out of sight, and to make the Tortoise feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a Hare, he lay down beside the course to take a nap until the Tortoise should catch up.

The Tortoise meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the Hare was sleeping. But the Hare slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up, the Tortoise was near the goal. The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.

Reality defies simple explanation. It's easy to think of agility as a hare. Quick, nimble, energetic, explosive, tight corners, etc, etc. It's easy to think of big, stilted organizations as the tortoise. Slow, heavy, 0-60 maybe. Yet this story presents a paradoxical truth: that focus and determination can produce can produce remarkable results.

The sotry of my time at BOKF is a bit like the tortoise. There's no hare in my story like there was in the fable. We market position was and remains seemingly stable. But that's what makes our progress even more remarkable. Who keeps pushing constantly? The team that feels under threat by a rival competitor, not the insulated team with a successful product inside a company that's surved over a hundred years. We have every reason to take it easy. Why bother? Leave well enough along. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!

For those of you know who me, you know the passion I have for calling people forth to improve and change things for the better. Faced with many seemingly intractable problems, my frustrations can get the better of me causing me to disengage. With this team however, what seem like intractable problems at first glance, proved to be anything but. Almost as bad as "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" is the sentiment I've encountered often, "It'll never change." Both act to sap the motivation. One denies a problem, the other denies hope. My job, as it turns out was to illustrate problems and jealously guard hope.

--------------

It was an odd hiring experience. I wasn't particularly looking for a new job and I certainly wasn't envisioning my next step would be into a bank that had been trading for over 100 years. From what I had heard, there were a few industries that were notoriously difficult for agility to thrive: health care and banking. The first call was unremarkable except that it led to an in-person meeting...and then another..and then they made me an offer I didn't refuse.

When I started, the first things I saw were difficulties:
- clunky, slow processes. I actually was sent home my first day because my user hadn't been completely added to our Active Directory system.
- Fledgling understanding of Scrum and agility
- Scrum wasn't producing potentially shippable product
   - 2 teams, neither was cross-functional
   - no definition of "Done" to speak of
   - out of about 12 Developers, only 2 had significant programming experience. The rest were BA's.
- long, costly manual regression. No automated tests or skill in writing automated tests
- The software we were developing was from a vendor; limited control and significant problems in the relationship.
- deployment to DEV and QA process was manual: 3 "slots" for manual deployments each day. Had to manually copy changed files, including instructions. Error prone, frustrating, costly in terms of time

They wanted me. Ready to trust me. More importantly, ready for something to try.

What is your favorite game to play?
When you're invited to play and not made to play
That I want to play, and that I can win
One that, after a while, I realize I actually do love instead of dislike.

Humor is very important, perhaps the 6th scrum value?

I worried if this talk would be compelling, give it a simplicity and lack of novelty. Then I remembered how influential it was when I learned that the most successful scrum adoptions take about 5 years

Learn to trust the team all over again.
My resting state is something like active not caring. This is my happy place, where I ignore conflict and experience the Peace of blissful apathy.
When I care about something a lot, I moved to act and seek results. This can very easily turn into worry, coddling, anxiety, and command and control.

Trusting the team means you believe and act as if you believe that they can manage themselves and self-organize to accomplish the goals they set for themselves.

But, let's be real. An individual or a team isn't always trustworthy. They could lack the competence, clarity, and personal integrity to warrant that trust.

## Still Agile
My grandma started walking a mile a day when she was 45. She's 84 now and we have no idea where she is!!

small improvements add up over time...if you don't quit. small improvements are are not very exciting and generally don't make for good talks IMHO. Big improvements are exciting, revolutionary, and make for great presentations

What happens when you add time as a factor in the equation? Well, how long can you sustain revolutionary change? Big changes make wow and sizzle for short periods. When they become status quo, that steady state becomes the next launching point for a new revolution. Big changes are dramatic, chaotic, exciting, tiring, troublesome, draining, and unsustainable IMHO. After a time of status quo, a new revolution may come around after a good long while.

Small changes are much less difficult, can be more orderly, a bit boring, less troublesome, energizing and much more sustainable. Over time, like with grandma, those changes can add up to extraordinary progress.

But...is this agile? I would say so:

>Agile processes promote sustainable development.The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

I've told why I think small changes are more sustainable. Organizations need to balance the risk of their activities. Big risks can lead to big failures. Small risks lead to small failuers that are more palatable as learning experiences. The bigger the bet, the fewer you're inclined to take and the more unbalanced your approach. Eggs in one basket, and all that. Smaller bets means more bets, more "better" failures balanced with success. More baskets, fewer broken eggs. Still agile

>Continuous attention to technical excellenceand good design enhances agility.

Continuous, not just during times of revolutionary improvemet. Not all technical improvements are small, but many are. Small improvements like introducing your first unit tests and getting those tests into a build and release pipline are fairly small, if you have a build and release pipeline. the Pipeline can be big. Uncle Bob's "Boy Scout Rule" in code is an example to continuous attention to technical excellence. Learning for 30 minutes each week adds up over time. Still agile.

>Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amountof work not done--is essential.

Big change quickly risks all kinds of mistakes. Buy-in, oversights, unintended consequences, etc. Recovering from and reworking problems inherent in big-bang change is wasteful. All that time spent reworking, rearchitecting, and even rehiring is time and energy you could be spending on valuable work. If you have the time to spare, make the small, step by step improvements you need towards achieving the big goal over time. Still agile.

>At regular intervals, the team reflects on howto become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

Small improvements occasionally are not sufficient to solve big, pervasive problems. Revolutionary change occasionally might (remember the risk). Small improvemets continuously can solve big, pervasive problems. Still agile.

## Tradoffs of Organizational Change

small improvements over time establish trust and track record. Hard to argue with consistent success. Trust makes everything faster and cheaper. The next change becomes easier because of the solid foundation added to by previous, incremental changes.

### Breadth, Committment, and Urgency
The Scrum practitioner community is fond of using three terms to describe the tradeoffs made in a software development project. They are:

- Scope
- Quality
- Time
What if your craft is not software development but organizational change?

#### Breadth
This is the scope of the organizational change. I would define it as a function of number of people affected, how each affected person’s work must change, and how the affected person’s mindset must be changed.

#### Commitment
This the quality of the organizational change. People resist being coerced to change as a natural instinct. An organizational change that is forced may garner compliance but it will rarely accomplish commitment. Commitment implies workers agree and would do it even if they were not required.

#### Urgency
This is the time constraint of the organizational change. We need to get Agile by the end of the year. We need to re-organize all our teams to be co-located this quarter. Effective immediately, everyone needs to use the new TPS report cover sheets.

#### Flex on Breadth and Urgency, not Commitment
Professional Scrum Development holds to a consistently high, even uncompromising level of quality leaving the Scrum Team to flex on either scope or time. Committing to high quality guards a project and a codebase against the calcification that a build up of broken software and technical debt inevitably brings. Additionally, a strict adherence to craftsmanship ensures workers are encouraged, even forced to expand their personal mastery of necessary skills and aptitudes. Moreover, those workers receive the pride of their workmanship and are afforded the time needed.

Organizational change agents should hold to a consistently high, even uncompromising level of commitment leaving the those desiring change to flex on breadth and urgency. Waiting on genuine commitment from workers guards an organization from the false change, dishonesty and the division organizational debt inevitably brings. Additionally, a strict requirement for genuine leadership ensures managers are encouraged, even forced to expand their personal mastery of necessary skills and aptitudes. Moreover, those managers receive the pride of their workmanship and are afforded the time needed.

The next time you, as a manager, force your underlings to just, “Do what I say” consider it the equivalent of an irresponsible, untested hack made made in production code that will probably cause more defects than it fixes.

## What kills continuous improvements?

### Little Quits
It’s rare that one quits something big without first quitting many times on something small.

Do you remember that essay project in school? It seemed so imposing until you wrote the first draft then got someone to give you feedback on it? Maybe it was something different, like quitting a habit. it seemed impossible until you saw a plan to ween yourself from a behavior and got someone to check up on your progress?

If you’re like me, there are many little things that lead up to big things. Too often, I’m thwarted in the little things because I’m thinking of the big thing. The small thing is really not that hard but the big thing looms large and seems impossible. In these cases, I find myself quitting little and failing big.

I propose that when I fail big it’s because I quit little; little quits led to a big quit. I didn’t believe in the big triumph and therefore couldn’t believe in the success of the little.

What if we reversed it? What if we start believing in the importance of the little things that seem possible rather than the big things that feel out of reach? We may find we succeed more and more in the little things and end up succeeding more and more in the bigs.

Start saying no to the little quits, and you start saying yes to the big successes.

What are your little quits?

### Lack of vision
If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Leave well enough alone. Inattention to results. Complacency. Lack of courage and commitment. No vision means we focus on our feet rather than the horizon. Imagine trying to sail a ship that way!

### Abuse of authority -- poor leadership
So you have a vision. "Do what I say, or else" undermines the power others are willing to give you. French and Raven's

### Counterproductive incentive structure
A bad system beats a good man every day. - Deming
Any fool can make a short term profit.
My personal success give me a raise; my team's success threatens my personal success

### What sustains improvement?

#### Commitment and en(Courage)ment
It takes courage to keep going when you're tired or discouraged. Your hope is the driving force that motivates courageous action. Dedication to preserving hope and avoiding jaded attitude is necessary. If the vision is compelling enough, the committment will follow so long as the hope is alive and well. Guard hope, like a fire. Stoke it with vision, purpose, and belonging.

#### Compelling Vision
There must be a reason to do the hard thing. Why suffer? Why not take it easy, be apathetic and comfortable? Well, you may only be able to be apathetic and comfortable for a while practially speaking.

#### Right understanding of and exercise of entrusted power

[6 Forms of Power](https://controlyourchaos.wordpress.com/2013/12/17/scrum-masters-toolkit-french-ravens-5-6-forms-of-power/)
[Psychological Models in Scrum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyDYpGCuvaA&t=1322s)
Gun to your head example.

##### 1 Reward and 2 Coercive
These two forms are the most common in nature. Every animal is susceptible to those. Basically they mean that you can do something for someone in order to receive a reward or avoid punishment. This is exactly the carrot & stick. If you use this power, you will get obedience. But nothing more. So if you want your dog to obey, you can give him or her treats to reinforce good behavior and punish bad. But remember, even if you do that , you might not be able to take control over your dog. Because when you turn around, the sausage will still disappear. Exactly the same applies to humans. If you reward and punish, everything will go towards what you reward and what you punish will be hidden. But apart from that, no creativity can be expected.

##### 3 Given / Formal / Legitimate
This power is only present in creatures who build societies. Did you ever watch The Dog Whisperer with Cesar Millan? If you did, try to remember what he wanted to achieve. He was the Pack Leader for the dog and taught owners how to do the same. He wanted the dog to be submissive. And this is exactly what you will have if you have formal power over someone – like a manager or a police officer. Someone who is high in social ranks, somehow culturally above someone else. But if you operate with this power, you will have submission and submission only. There is still very little creativity involved.

##### 4 Expert
Expert power is something that can be described as being respected, because you know a lot or can do something. This is something that has not been observed in any creatures, besides human. Some researchers believe dolphins, elephants, apes and crows may exhibit that power as well, but no hard proof has been found yet.  Working with someone with that power over you, gives you wings to learn. You want to become just like this example someone, so you listen, follow footsteps and try to master this subject. This power gives you learning and conquering difficulties.

##### 5 Referent
This is a power that’s closest to trust. In large quantities it’s perceived as Charisma. It’s something that produces good feelings and engagement. It’s a power that’s easiest to lose and hardest to gain. You feel that this person is just right, you follow their lead. It’s something good leaders have.

##### 6* Informational
Why is there an asterisk here? Because this power was added later on, it wasn’t in the original research. This is a power that is present only in informational societies. Where having, withholding or manipulating information is possible. Some also argue if this is not only a different manifestation of a rewarding or coercive power. I will leave it for your consideration.

##### Why do I care?
Because the higher the power number is, the harder it is to gain, but the bigger the benefits are. It’s easy to coerce someone to do something, threatening them to sack them or promising a yearly bonus.

Also because coercive and rewarding powers are encoded in our reptilian brain, they are our instincts and it’s extremely hard in a critical situation not to use them.  Same applies to given power – only if you give in to your instincts, the more primitive one will take over – the carrot and the stick.

And in critical situations we need creativity, learning and engagement the most – to quickly get out of that crisis.

That’s why Scrum Masters have to have Expert and Referent power but not formal, coercive or rewarding ones. So that they can get the most of people any time.s
