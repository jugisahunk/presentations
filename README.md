## The Tortoise and the Hare
* A journey into the concept of agility as embodied by the tortoise in the classic fable. This talk explores the sometimes counterintuitive notion that "slow and steady" can agile made real by my experience as Scrum Master for a Scrum Team. Along the way, it examines the ways in which the tortoise demonstrates agility, the trade-offs needed to navigate organizational change, and what will kill or sustain the tortoise's efforts.
